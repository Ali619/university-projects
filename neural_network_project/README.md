## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network using Python. Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain, capable of learning patterns from data and making predictions or classifications.

If you’re new to neural networks or machine learning, don’t worry! This document will walk you through the basics and explain how each part of the project works.

## How Neural Networks Work (High-Level)

A neural network is a collection of connected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes the result to the next layer. The network learns by adjusting the connections (weights) between neurons to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual answers (labels).

**Key steps in a neural network project:**
1. **Prepare Data:** Load and preprocess the data so the model can learn from it.
2. **Define Model:** Specify the architecture (layers, neurons, activation functions).
3. **Train Model:** Feed data to the model, compare predictions to actual answers, and adjust weights to improve accuracy.
4. **Evaluate/Use Model:** Test the model’s performance or use it to make predictions.

## How This Project Works

### Data Loading (`data_loader.py`)

- **Purpose:** Reads your dataset, preprocesses it (e.g., normalization, splitting into training/testing sets), and provides it to the model.
- **How it works:** 
  - Loads data from a file or source.
  - Cleans and formats the data.
  - Splits data into training and testing sets.
  - Returns data in a format suitable for the model (often as NumPy arrays or PyTorch/TensorFlow tensors).

### Model Definition (`model.py` and `models/`)

- **Purpose:** Defines the structure of the neural network.
- **How it works:**
  - Specifies the number of layers, type of layers (e.g., fully connected, convolutional), and activation functions.
  - Contains the logic for the forward pass (how data moves through the network).
  - May include methods for saving/loading the model.

### Training Logic (`trainer.py`)

- **Purpose:** Handles the process of teaching the model to learn from data.
- **How it works:**
  - Receives the model and data.
  - Runs the training loop: feeds data to the model, calculates loss (difference between prediction and actual), and updates model weights.
  - Tracks performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss).
  - May include validation/testing steps to check how well the model is learning.

### Main Script (`main.py`)

- **Purpose:** The entry point that ties everything together.
- **How it works:**
  - Loads data using `data_loader.py`.
  - Initializes the model from `model.py`.
  - Trains the model using `trainer.py`.
  - May save the trained model or print results.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Requirements:**
   - Open a terminal in the `neural_network_project` directory.
   - Run:  
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Main Script:**
   - In the same terminal, run:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - This will start the training process and print progress/results to the terminal.

---

## Requirements

All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Common packages for neural network projects include:
- numpy
- pandas
- torch or tensorflow (for neural networks)
- scikit-learn (for data processing)

---

## Summary

- **Data is loaded and preprocessed** by `data_loader.py`.
- **The neural network model is defined** in `model.py` (and possibly in `models/`).
- **The model is trained** using the logic in `trainer.py`.
- **Everything is orchestrated** by `main.py`, which you run to start the process.

This project is a basic example of how machine learning systems are structured. As you get more comfortable, you can experiment with different models, datasets, and training techniques!
